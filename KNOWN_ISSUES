Current issues:

TFTP ACKs go out of synchronization somehow
-------------------------------------------

In some rare cases, the TFTP client seems to get out of sync with the server.
This problem manifests itself as follows:

* The client receives packet N, and sends an ACK for packet N (as usual).
* The client receives packet N+1, but responds with another ACK for packet N
  (suggesting that packet N+1 was lost).
* The client keeps re-sending ACK for packet N, and the server responds
  (correctly) with packet N+1, but the client seems not to accept this packet.
  The loading process doesn't progress beyond packet N.

Perhaps something goes wrong when a bit error is detected in packet N+1 the
first time around, and the internal state (expected packet) somehow becomes
invalid.  I haven't figured out how this would happen.

The problem happens rarely, so the obvious workaround is to reset the machine
and reload the snapshot.
