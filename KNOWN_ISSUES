Current issues:

TFTP ACKs go out of synchronization somehow
-------------------------------------------

In some cases, the TFTP client seems to get out of sync with the server.  This
problem manifests itself as follows:

* The client receives packet N, and sends an ACK for packet N.
* The client receives packet N+1, but keeps ACK:ing packet N.
* The client keeps re-sending ACK for packet N, and the server responds
  (correctly) with packet N+1, but the client seems not to accept this packet.

Perhaps something goes wrong when a bit error is detected in packet N+1 the
first time around.
