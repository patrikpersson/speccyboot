v1.3 (under development):

* Added patch for SpeccyBoot emulation in FUSE.

* Simplified context switch.

* Added BASIC example for SPI bit-banging.

* Added support for booting into alternate EEPROM bank (by pressing Symbol
  Shift during boot).

* Trampoline camouflage enhanced: select paper or ink colour depending
  on the pixel intensity in the cell.

* Fixed a bug where IPv4 packets with the DF flag set would be dropped.

* Removed EMULATOR_TEST build (unnecessary now that we can emulate
  SpeccyBoot in FUSE).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2 (November 1, 2009):

* Better support for 128k snapshots. (Resolved an issue where memory was mapped
  incorrectly for 128k snapshots. Postponed sound register updates to the
  final context switch, instead of during header parsing.)

* Register R now has the correct value after the context switch. (Probably
  matters to very few, if any, applications.)

* Distorted pixels in top-left corner (necessary for trampoline code) are now
  camouflaged by setting ink colour to the same as paper colour in those
  attribute cells.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1 (October 17, 2009):

* Resolved a timing issue on the Spectrum 128 (a contended page was mistakenly
  paged into the 0xc000..0xffff region for 48k snapshots). This issue led to,
  among other things, distorted sound in some games.

* Preliminary support for 16k and 128k snapshots.

* Revised .WAV file generator, to include BASIC loader and firmware writer
  in the generated file.
  
* Removed remaining non-functional parts of ICMP stack.

* Addressed minor compiler warnings.

* Now retains TFTP server address, avoiding unnecessary subnet broadcasts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0 (August 13, 2009):

* First release.
