v5 (August 12, 2021):

* Faster SPI communication
* Clearer version indicator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v4 (July 29, 2021):

* Continued footprint optimizations: entire loader now fits in 2K ROM, so no
  code is needed in RAM. The index file loaded over TFTP (menu.dat) only
  contains the snapshot table, no code. The menu.dat file is now smaller,
  loads faster, and largely independent from the firmware version.
* Fixed boot delay for 128k reset logic (avoiding some sporadic boot crashes).
* The user interface is initialized earlier, so we can see better what the
  machine is up to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v3 (July 17, 2021):

* Optimized footprint further: all code except the menu application
  now fits in 2K ROM; no code in RAM is necessary for loading snapshots.
* Faster SPI stack (~60 kbit/s).
* Snapshots (*.z80) can be loaded directly, without user intervention,
  if the BOOTP 'file' field is set to a suitable snapshot file name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.0 (May 20, 2021):

* Major refactoring to squeeze SpeccyBoot into a 2K ROM.
* Replaced DHCP with BOOTP.
* Rewritten entirely in Z80 assembly language.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.8 (April 24, 2021):

* DHCP option 67 (boot file name).
* IP address display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.7 (April 10, 2021):

* Made DHCP server more RFC compliant (added support for options 66, 150)
* Made TFTP server more RFC compliant (doesn't use broadcast address)
* Compiler update to SDCC 3.8.0.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.6 (May 3, 2015):

* Migrated to Github.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5 (July 26, 2012):

* Support for Imrich Konkol's alternate DGBoot hardware design.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4 (January 16, 2010):

* Major refactoring to squeeze SpeccyBoot into an 8K (E(E)P)ROM/FRAM.

* Simplified menu screen.

* Improved software support for 16K/+2A/+3 machines. (Only tested in
Fuse.)

* Syslog output slightly enhanced (PRI and TAG fields).

* A TFTP RRQ message is now always broadcast, but the subsequent ACKs
are unicast (reverted to version 1.0 behaviour to save some space).

* Revised WAV loader application to support EEPROMs with and without
software-controlled write protection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.3 (December 1, 2009):

* Added patch for SpeccyBoot emulation in FUSE.

* Simplified context switch.

* Added BASIC example for SPI bit-banging.

* Added support for booting into alternate EEPROM/flash bank (by
  pressing Symbol Shift during boot).

* Trampoline camouflage enhanced: select paper or ink colour depending
  on the pixel intensity in the cell.

* Fixed a bug where some IPv4 packets would be dropped in error.

* Stability fixes in Ethernet stack.

* Cosmetic adjustments in menu screen.

* Removed EMULATOR_TEST build (unnecessary now that we can emulate
  SpeccyBoot in FUSE).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2 (November 1, 2009):

* Better support for 128k snapshots. (Resolved an issue where memory was mapped
  incorrectly for 128k snapshots. Postponed sound register updates to the
  final context switch, instead of during header parsing.)

* Register R now has the correct value after the context switch. (Probably
  matters to very few, if any, applications.)

* Distorted pixels in top-left corner (necessary for trampoline code) are now
  camouflaged by setting ink colour to the same as paper colour in those
  attribute cells.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1 (October 17, 2009):

* Resolved a timing issue on the Spectrum 128 (a contended page was mistakenly
  paged into the 0xc000..0xffff region for 48k snapshots). This issue led to,
  among other things, distorted sound in some games.

* Preliminary support for 16k and 128k snapshots.

* Revised .WAV file generator, to include BASIC loader and firmware writer
  in the generated file.
  
* Removed remaining non-functional parts of ICMP stack.

* Addressed minor compiler warnings.

* Now retains TFTP server address, avoiding unnecessary subnet broadcasts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0 (August 13, 2009):

* First release.
