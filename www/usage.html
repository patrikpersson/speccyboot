          <p>In addition to a SpeccyBoot-equipped Spectrum, two more machines
          are needed in your network. However, your probably already have
          them:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>A DHCP server (virtually all broadband routers include this)</li>
          <li>A TFTP server (a server application on a desktop/laptop
          computer)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These should be on the same network. Typically, you will just plug
          in both your Spectrum and your TFTP server to your router.</p>
          
          <p><b>NOTE:</b> The current version of SpeccyBoot does not support
          more than one SpeccyBoot on the same local network (the MAC address
          is hard-coded).</p>
          
          <h2>TFTP server configuration</h2>
          
          <p>Your TFTP server <b>must be capable of responding to broadcast
          requests</b>, since that is what SpeccyBoot uses. Most (but not all)
          TFTP servers are, and some need an explicit option to enable this. I
          used the built-in TFTP server of Mac OS X 10.5
          (<a href="http://aplawrence.com/MacOSX/tftp.html">here's some hints
          on how to enable that</a>), and most Linux distributions either
          include a TFTP server by default, or allow you to install one
          quite easily. I believe there are some third-party TFTP servers for
          Windows too.</p>
          
          <h3>Preparing a directory of snapshots</h3>
          
          <p>Create a directory named <tt>speccyboot</tt> in your TFTP
          servers's main directory (in the case of Mac OS X 10.5, this is
          <tt>/private/tftpboot</tt>; many UNIX clones use <tt>/tftpboot</tt>).
          Copy your Z80 snapshots to this <tt>speccyboot</tt> directory, and
          create a (case-insensitively sorted) list of snapshots named
          <tt>snapshots.lst</tt>. On a UNIX system, this can be done as
          follows:</p>
          
          <p>
          <code># sudo mkdir /private/tftpboot/speccyboot<br>
          # sudo chown &lt;your-username&gt; /private/tftpboot/speccyboot<br>
          # cd /private/tftpboot/speccyboot<br>
          # cp &lt;path-to-snapshots&gt;/*.z80 .<br>
          # ls -1 *.z80 | sort --ignore-case > snapshots.lst
          </code>
          </p>
          
          <p>A few notes on this:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>It could be convenient to put the last line in a script, so you
          can update the list easily whenever the directory is modified.</li>
          <li>The sorting is not strictly required &mdash; but without it,
          you will not be able to jump (predictably) in the snapshot list by
          pressing an alphabetic key.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <hr>
                    
          <h2>Loading snapshots</h2>

          <p>If the steps above went well, you should now be able to turn on
          your Spectrum, see it figure out its IP address aswell as that of the
          TFTP server, and present your list of snapshots. You can now use
          the arrow keys to navigate the list, the alphabetic keys to jump
          directly to snapshots whose name begin with that letter, and Enter
          to load the selected snapshot.</p>

          <p>To boot into BASIC rather than the SpeccyBoot menu, press Caps
          Shift and keep it pressed while power-cycling/resetting the
          Spectrum.</p>
